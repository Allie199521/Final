{\bf Cryptography Final - May 14th 2:45pm}\\
{\bf Review Sheet}\\

Need to know:\\
Advantages and Disadvantages of one time pad\\
Difference between Stream Ciphers and block ciphers\\
	block ciphers are more general - can you convert a block cipher into a stream cipher - yes, make block size one bit\\
	stream ciphers have more mathematical structure - statistical attacks - easier to break and easier to study\\
	block ciphers have no math involved - has to be reversable function\\
	stream ciphers are not suitable for software but highly efficient in hardware\\
	block ciphers are good in hardware and software but not as good in terms of hardware as stream cipher\\
	BC what is one time pad - attacks on one time pad - use same key - xoring two messages together gets the messages concatenated together.\\
	What is 3DES - bit length, keys to test in worse case $2^{56}$, average $2^{55}$ - encryption decryption and encryption\\
	DES - bit length, keys to test in worse case \\
	Why is 2 DES not secure - how does it work\\
	What is meet in the middle attack - cuts in half the amount of keys to check\\
Brute force attacks and time it will take to do.\\
	how to do something in the brute force method\\
Most likelyhood of something to happen probability\\
Factorization of a number made of 2 primes - product of 3 primes instead of 2 primes\\
	how to find phi with 3 prime values\\
	given some cipher from Alice, how would you decrypt it?\\
	think about it for every algorithm thats out there\\
	also think about chinese remainder theorem\\
diffie helman - given $g^a$ and $g^b$, finding $g^{ab}$ is hard... how?\\
	given generator, compute the $g^{ab}$\\
	Elgamal- how it works.\\
	how to involve 3 people into this?\\
	sending encrypted message from alice to bob, you have $g^{ab}$ and for bob and carol you get $g^{bc}$.\\
	m = 59, g = 2, p = 227.  Alice has a = 8, bob b = 6, carol c = 5.  $H_a = 29$, $H_b = 64$, $H_c = 32$ (all mod 227).  Alice will generate $g^{ab}$ using Bobs half mask. $F_{ab} = 12$.  If you don't get the same full mask for bob and alice, its wrong.  Same thing for bob and carol.  $F_{bc} = 44$\\
	p = 2q+1 - safe prime\
	q = $\frac{p-1}{2}$\\
	$g^1 \neq 1$\\
	$g^2 \neq 1$\\
	$g^q \neq 1$\\
	
Diffie helman - Elliptic Curve\\
	Same security in EC - 128 as Elgamal 256.\\
	Given a curve, only thing on the curve will be the quadratic residues.\\
	given a set, show me a formula to find the quadratic residues. - Legranges symbol. $(\frac{x}{p}) = x ^{\frac{p-1}{2}} mod\ p$ if we get 1, it is a quadratic residue, -1 is going to be a non quadratic residue.\\
	finding the square roots of $x$ raise x to the (p+1)/4 and mod by p\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item RSA - Public Key Encryption. \\
{\bf Given: }\\ $n$ a small prime\\ $e$ smallest odd integer with gcd with $\phi$ of 1\\ $c$ an encrypted message\\
{\bf Needed: }\\ $p$ and $q$ two prime numbers whose products are n\\ $\phi = (p-1)(q-1)$\\
$d = e^{-1}$\\
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] Find the primes $p$ and $q$.  If you do not have a prime factorization on your calculator, then know that one of them is going to be less $\sqrt{n}$, knowing this, we can test all primes less than $\sqrt{n}$.\\
\item[(b)] Calculate $\phi = (p-1)(q-1)$.  From here, it should be easy to find $e$ if it is not given.  Parse through lowest odd values until you find one where $gcd(e, \phi) = 1$.\\
\item[(c)] Now that you have $e$, you have to use pulverizer to solve for $d$.
