{\bf Need to know:}\\

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Advantages and Disadvantages of one time pad
	\begin{itemize}
	\item{} {\bf Advantages:}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item{} Impossible to crack if the key is never reused, completely random and kept secret	
		\item{} Immune to brute force attacks - trying all keys simply yields all plaintexts, all equally likely to be the acual plaintext.
		\end{itemize}
	\item{} {\bf Disadvantages:}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item{} Hard to find a truly random key, possible by: psuedorandom number generator
		\item{} Security of the one time pad is only as secure as the exchange of the key - if this is not secure, then the key isn't either.
		\item{} It is difficult to make sure that it continues to remain a secret - dispose of it after first use properly.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\item{} Difference between Stream Ciphers and block ciphers
\begin{itemize}
	\item{} {\bf Block Ciphers:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{}More general i.e. can you convert a block cipher into a stream cipher?  Yes, make block size one bit
		\item{}Have no math involved - has to be reversable function
		\item{}Are good in hardware and software but not as good in terms of hardware as stream cipher
	\end{itemize}
	\item{} {\bf Stream Ciphers:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{}stream ciphers have more mathematical structure - statistical attacks - easier to break and easier to study
		\item{}stream ciphers are not suitable for software but highly efficient in hardware
	\end{itemize}
	\item{}What is 3DES - three 56 bit keys
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{} Keys to test in worse case $2^{56\cdot 3}$, average $2^{55*3}$
		\item{} 3DES takes in 3 keys, and uses the first key to encrypt a message, the second key to decrypt the encrypted message and then uses the third key to reincrypt the decrypted message.
	\end{itemize}
	\item{}DES - bit length, keys to test in worse case
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{} Keys to test in worse case $2^{56}$, average $2^{55}$
	\end{itemize}
	\item{}Why is 2 DES not secure?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{} Not secure because the brute force attack of it is less than $2^{90}$.
		\item{} Keys to test in worse case $2^{56\cdot 2}$.
		\item{} 2DES takes 2 keys and encrypts the message with one of them and then decrypts with the other key.
		\item{} Keys cannot be the same or else you are sending out the message with no decryption.
	\end{itemize}
	\item{}What is meet in the middle attack - cuts in half the amount of keys to check
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{} 
	\end{itemize}
	\item{}BC what is one time pad - attacks on one time pad - use same key - xoring two messages together gets the messages concatenated together.
\end{itemize}
\item{}Brute force attacks and time it will take to do.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item{} How to brute force decrypt something.
	\item{} Worst case: bits = n, so $2^n$.
	\item{} Average case: bits = n, so $\frac{2^n}{2} = 2^{n-1}$
	\end{itemize}
\item{}Most likelyhood of something to happen - probability - you are on your own.
\item{}Factorization of a number made of 2 primes - product of 3 primes instead of 2 primes
	\begin{itemize}
	\item{}how to find phi with 3 prime values $(p-1)(q-1)(r-1)$
	\item{}given some cipher from Alice, how would you decrypt it?
	\item{}also think about chinese remainder theorem
	\end{itemize}
\item{}diffie helman - given $g^a$ and $g^b$, finding $g^{ab}$ is hard... how?
	\begin{itemize}
	\item{}given generator, compute the $g^{ab}$
	\item{}Elgamal- how it works.
	\item{}how to involve 3 people into this?
	\item{}sending encrypted message from alice to bob, you have $g^{ab}$ and for bob and carol you get $g^{bc}$.
	\item{}m = 59, g = 2, p = 227.  
	\item{}Alice has a = 8, bob b = 6, carol c = 5.  $H_a = 29$, $H_b = 64$, $H_c = 32$ (all mod 227).  
	\item{} Alice will generate $g^{ab}$ using Bobs half mask. $F_{ab} = 12$.  If you don't get the same full mask for bob and alice, its wrong.  Same thing for bob and carol.  $F_{bc} = 44$
	\item{}p = 2q+1 - safe prime
	\item{}q = $\frac{p-1}{2}$
	\item{}$g^1 \neq 1$
	\item{}$g^2 \neq 1$
	\item{}$g^q \neq 1$
	\end{itemize}
\item{}Diffie helman - Elliptic Curve
	\begin{itemize}
	\item{}Same security in EC - 128 as Elgamal 256.
	\item{}Given a curve, only thing on the curve will be the quadratic residues.
	\item{}given a set, show me a formula to find the quadratic residues. - Legranges symbol. $(\frac{x}{p}) = x ^{\frac{p-1}{2}} mod\ p$ if we get 1, it is a quadratic residue, -1 is going to be a non quadratic residue.
	\item{}finding the square roots of $x$ raise x to the (p+1)/4 and mod by p
	\item{}get ascii character to the (x1, y1) character when turning it into a cipher - m is a point on the curve.  ALICE has her own multiplier, bob will have his own multiplier. - use them to encrypt their own half masks B = 4g and A = 3g.  F = B * 3 (bobs halfmask times Alice's multiplier.
	\item{}make sure you can find all of the points on the curve. you dont have to find the square roots if the number is not -1 when raised to the power of (p-1)/2 mod the number.
	\item{}the generator value is a point on the curve and the message point is a point on the curve.  ALL OF THE THINGS YOU GET IS A POINT ON THE CURVE.
	\end{itemize}
